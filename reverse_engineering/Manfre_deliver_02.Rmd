Paragraph: “We set the pace in fundraising — including raising more money in Maryland and having 73% of donations $100 or less — because this campaign has inspired thousands of people from all walks of life in Maryland and across the country who see the opportunity to make Wes Moore governor of Maryland and change the trajectories of families who have been left behind,” the campaign said in a statement."

Summary of what we've done: "Essentially the goal of this was to gather each data set and make it clean so we can use it. The limitations from using the state data are that the address column contains a full address and there is not a column just for states. But we can use a str_detect_ to create this. There are also some columsn with NAs in them but they are just place holders for columns that have shown refunds in the candidates' expenditures columns. 

We are curious why Elrich/Blair dont show up on dem_results_22 but do show up on every other file for this question."

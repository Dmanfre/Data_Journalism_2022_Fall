**This is code for question 2 which is showing the top 5 contributors to blair and elrich in 2022 and in 2018. Are there any connections to the candidates**

```{r}
 top_blair_2022_contribs <- blair_contribs_2022 %>%
  mutate(contributor_name = case_when(
    contributor_name == "BLAIR  DAVID  THOMAS" ~ "Blair  David  Thomas",
    TRUE ~ contributor_name
  )) %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(5)

```
```{r}
top_blair_contribs_18 <- blair_contribs_2018 %>%
  mutate(contributor_name = case_when(

    TRUE ~ contributor_name
  )) %>%
  group_by(contributor_name) %>%
  summarize(total = sum(contribution_amount)) %>%
  arrange(desc(total)) %>%
  head(5)

### David Blair has family who donated to him in 2022 and 2018 and they are all his top 5 donors.

Summary of what we've done: "Essentially the goal of this was to gather each data set and make it clean so we can use it. The limitations from using the state data are that the address column contains a full address and there is not a column just for states. But we can use a str_detect_ to create this. There are also some columsn with NAs in them but they are just place holders for columns that have shown refunds in the candidates' expenditures columns. 

We are curious why Elrich/Blair dont show up on dem_results_22 but do show up on every other file for this question."

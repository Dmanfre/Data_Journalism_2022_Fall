### In 22, Elrich was his No. 2 donor but he got a lot of money from the Montgomery County government.

```{r} * **Quesion 3*: David Blair got more early/election day votes in 2022. Elrich got more Mail-in votes in 2022. How did that compare to 2018? People want to know how Marc Elrich won both times, first by 72 voters in 2018 and then 32 in 2022. Where did Marc do well in the three categories: Early voting, election day, and mail-in votes. Did this sway the result at all?

**Answer** He did not get more election day votes in 2018. 


```{r}
#data for 2018
blair <- dem_results_18 %>% 
filter(candidate_name == "David Blair")

elrich <-  dem_results_18 %>% 
  filter(candidate_name == "Marc Elrich")

blair_elrich_18 <-  bind_rows(blair, elrich)

blair_elrich_18

#data for 2022

blair_elrich_22 <- dem_results_22 %>%
filter(candidate_name == "David T. Blair" | candidate_name == "Marc Elrich") %>% 
group_by(candidate_name) %>% 
summarize(total_votes = sum(early_votes+election_night_votes+mail_in_ballot_1_votes+provisional_votes+mail_in_ballot_2_votes))



```

### Question 4
* **Question**: Which parts of the county voted for Elrich and which voted for Blair based on precinct-level voting? Are there differences in demographics of those areas? What about income?

**Question 5**

analysis: There are signifant differences in spending between Elrich and Blair here and it shows how the capital on hand can really influence the means a candidate has to win or lose a race. Elrich in 2022 went all-in on TV spending. Blair spent a lot more in 2018 as well. Blair spent just over 900k on online ads in 2018 and just 1,773 in 2022 â€” a massive decline. 

```{r}

blair_expenses_2022 %>% 
group_by(expense_category) %>% 
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_category))
#spent nearly $3.1 mil in 2022 ... top 3 are Media, Salarties and Direct Mail by Mail House (R)

#dive into media
blair_expenses_2022 %>% 
filter(expense_category == "Media") %>% 
group_by(expense_purpose) %>% 
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_category))
# Spent 1773.00	 on online advertising in 2022

elrich_expenses_2022 %>% 
group_by(expense_category) %>% 
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_category))
# Elrich spent $528393.29 on media which is significantly less than Blair

elrich_expenses_2022 %>% 
filter(expense_category == "Media") %>% 
group_by(expense_purpose) %>% 
summarize(total_category = sum(amount)) %>% 
arrange(desc(total_category))
#Elrich spent 32K on consulting fees.

```




Summary of what we've done: "Essentially the goal of this was to gather each data set and make it clean so we can use it. The limitations from using the state data are that the address column contains a full address and there is not a column just for states. But we can use a str_detect_ to create this. There are also some columsn with NAs in them but they are just place holders for columns that have shown refunds in the candidates' expenditures columns. 

We are curious why Elrich/Blair dont show up on dem_results_22 but do show up on every other file for this question."

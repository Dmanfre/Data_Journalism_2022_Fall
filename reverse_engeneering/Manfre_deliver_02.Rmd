paragrah: Sanunu's paragraph

Paragraph: “We set the pace in fundraising — including raising more money in Maryland and having 73% of donations $100 or less — because this campaign has inspired thousands of people from all walks of life in Maryland and across the country who see the opportunity to make Wes Moore governor of Maryland and change the trajectories of families who have been left behind,” the campaign said in a statement."

```{r}

wes_moore_data <- read_csv("data/Contributionslist.csv")

```
```{r}
### making the column names lowercase with underscore
clean_wes_moore_data <- wes_moore_data %>% 
clean_names()

```

```{r}
### change the dates to be the proper format
clean_dates <- clean_wes_moore_data %>% 
mutate(contribution_date = mdy(contribution_date))
head(clean_dates)

```

```{r}
### Changing chr field to number field
clean_dates %>% 
mutate(across(contribution_amount, as.numeric))
head(clean_dates)
```

```{r}
clean_dates %>%
filter(contribution_amount <= 100) %>% 
arrange(desc(contribution_amount))


### We were able to get the code to show donations of 100 or less but unable to arrange them from greatest to least. Whenever I did arrange(desc(contribution_amount)) it only showed me donations of 100. 


```
